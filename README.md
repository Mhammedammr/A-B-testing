# A/B testing

The client has a two web page designs (old & new designs) for an e-commerce website, the new design is constructed in order to increase the number of users who decide to pay for the client's product (conversion). 

A/B test with python is conducted by 3 ways: probability (classic way), A/B test (traditional one using statsmodels) & a regression model.

there was no significant positive effect measured. So, they do not need an A/B testing report and the full conclusion of the project is written as notes in a Jupyter Notebook attached below.

the conclusion is whether or not the new webpage design increase the revenue of the client.

note: if "convert" factor = 1 in the dataset, it means that the user purchase product.
